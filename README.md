                   @@@@@  INTRODUCTION ABOUT THE PROJECT @@@@@ 
		   

Online Artwork and Fine Arts is a place where Artwork to display and sell. So
for doing this they have to go to the exhibition with his artworks so that anyone
can come to the exhibition and buy the desirable art-work. The various
problems with the art exhibition are as follows: -
It must have to go to the exhibition to display their artworks every time.
Customers must have to go to the exhibition to buy any art, and if they don’t
like any art they have to come back so there is a chance of time loss.
Transportation of artworks to the exhibition and from exhibition to the buyer’s
home, so its take more time and more money.
The application Online Artwork and Fine Arts will provide another way for the
customer to book their new Art as per their choice. The project is aimed at
developing live feature rich. The application is a live based application that is
functioned through the software product and can be used by anyone who wants
to book art. The customer can simply visit and check for the Arts and the
information of the Arts with its complete description.
The page displays the facilities to open different links and options from the
home page. From the home page customer can open a link where he could
choose from different Arts, which will have the images with it. The clicking to
that Art will give the complete details of the Art. The customer can get the full
information of the Art which he/she wishes to buy. He/she can be satisfied by
just looking the details given in the application. The customer can book the Art
which he wishes to buy online where he just has to fill the booking form to give
his personal details and the Art can be booked so easily. Before filling the

the for the particulars to the booking form. The booked art will be delivered to
the customer within 15 working days or ASAP from the date of booking.
To make this application with successfully I am using some latest technology
such as BOOTSTRAP FRAMEWORK for designing, PHP as the Development
Platform MYSQL as the Database Management environment.


					 @@@@@ TECHNOLOGY USED @@@@@ 
					 
			
			1. BOOTSTRAP
			
Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful, mobile and web first front-end
framework for faster and easier web development. It uses HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript.
USE BOOTSTRAP
● First approach: Bootstrap framework consists of first styles throughout
the entire library instead of them in separate files.
● Browser Support: It is supported by all popular browsers.
● Easy to get started: With just the knowledge of HTML and CSS anyone
can get started with Bootstrap. Also, the Bootstrap official site has a good
documentation.
● Responsive design: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to Desktops,
Tablets, and Mobiles. More about the responsive design is in the chapter
Bootstrap Responsive Design. Provides a clean and uniform solution for
building an interface for developers.
And best of all it is an open source.

			2. APACHE SERVER
			
Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers
under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation.
What is the Apache Software Foundation?
1) The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is a non-profit 501(c)(3)
corporation, incorporated in Delaware, USA, in June of 1999.
2) The ASF is a natural outgrowth of the Apache Group, a group of individuals
that was initially formed in 1995 to develop the Apache HTTP Server.
			
			3. PHP
			
PHP, which stands for "Hypertext Preprocessor", is a server-side, HTML-
embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages.
PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more
people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first
version of PHP way back in 1994
Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java, and Perl with some unique
features thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow Web developers to write
dynamically generated pages quickly.
PHP Security
 PHP is a more secure language for writing CGI programs than Perl or C
and with the correct selection of compile-time and runtime configuration.
			
			4. MYSQL
			
MySQL provides an implementation of a SQL database very well suited for
small to medium web pages. The database is a free and open source with a
commercial license available (MySQL is now owned by Oracle after they
bought Sun).
