	# About Online Artwork and Fine Arts (Line Number: 6)
The Online Art Gallery and Fine Arts platform is designed to display and sell artwork through an online interface, eliminating the need for physical exhibitions. Traditionally, artists must transport their works to exhibitions, which is time-consuming and costly. Customers, on the other hand, must physically visit exhibitions to view and purchase art, which can lead to time loss if they are unable to find anything of interest. This platform provides a more convenient solution where customers can browse and book artwork online. Users can view detailed descriptions of various artworks, and if they wish to make a purchase, they simply need to fill out a booking form. New users must first register and authenticate themselves to access the booking system. The platform ensures delivery of purchased art within 15 working days or sooner.
This application has been built using the latest technologies such as Bootstrap Framework for design, PHP for development, and MySQL for database management.

Technologies Used
1. Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a responsive front-end framework designed for building mobile-first websites. It makes development faster and easier by offering predefined CSS and JavaScript components that help create sleek and consistent user interfaces.

2. Apache Server
Apache is an open-source web server software. It's highly reliable and works seamlessly with PHP and MySQL to deliver dynamic websites.

3. PHP
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely used server-side scripting language for web development. It's flexible and powerful, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive websites.

4. MySQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. It's used for storing and retrieving user and product data, including artwork details and customer bookings.

Modular Breakdown
1. Registration
The registration module allows users to sign up by entering their personal information, after which they can log in and proceed with the artwork booking process.

2. Login
The login module ensures that only registered users can access the platform. Both customers and admins must authenticate with valid credentials to proceed.

3. Search Art
This module enables customers to search and browse artworks based on various criteria like price, type, and description.

4. Book Art
Once a customer finds an artwork they like, they can use this module to place an order by filling out a booking form.

5. Cancel Booking
This feature allows customers to cancel their bookings if needed, and also gives admins the ability to manage cancellations.
